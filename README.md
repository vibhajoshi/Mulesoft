<p>Inserting data into Movies table. </p>

<p>Querying data from Movies table with or without parameters – after having the movies data in the table needed to query the movie details (name, actor, actress, director, year of release) using a SELECT statement. Then write a program to issue a simple SELECT statement to query all rows from the Movies table, as well as use a query with parameter like actor name to select movies based on the actor's name.</p>
